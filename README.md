# dotfiles
My dotfile configs and some scripts to manage them.

Use pull-dotfiles.sh to copy the dotfiles from this git repo to the host machine after cloning to your home directory. (Warning: this will overwrrite the dotfiles on the host machine!)

Use push-dotfile.sh to copy the host machine's dotfiles to the git repo directory, which can then be pushed to github.
